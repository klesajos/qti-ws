# Example 4: Project-scoped plugin

## What is a plugin?

A **plugin** bundles Claude Code extensions — skills, agents, hooks, MCP
servers, workflows — into one installable, versioned package. Plugins are
distributed through a **marketplace**: a catalog file that says "these
plugins exist and here is where to get them".

In examples 1–3 you put a skill, two hooks, and MCP servers directly into the
repo. That works great for *one* project. A plugin is the next step: the
same content packaged so it can be shared across many repos and teams.

This example shows the smallest possible setup: the repo is **its own
marketplace** offering **one plugin** that bundles **one skill** (and, from
Example 5, an agent).

## The moving parts

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json      ← the marketplace catalog (repo root)
plugins/2048-dev/                    ← the plugin itself
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json         ← plugin manifest (name, version, ...)
  skills/build-test/SKILL.md         ← one bundled skill
  agents/game-explorer.md            ← one bundled agent (Example 5)
.claude/settings.json                ← auto-registers + enables the plugin
```

Three layers, from inside out: a **skill** lives in a **plugin**, which is
listed in a **marketplace**, which the project's **settings** point to.

## Layer 1: the skill (`plugins/2048-dev/skills/build-test/SKILL.md`)

This plugin bundles a **skill**. The skill folder's name = the command name
(`skills/build-test/` → `/2048-dev:build-test`; the prefix is the plugin name).

> **Why a skill, not a command?** Custom slash commands have been **merged into
> skills** — `commands/build-test.md` and `skills/build-test/SKILL.md` both create
> `/2048-dev:build-test`. The legacy `commands/` form still works, but skills are
> the forward path (see the [cheat-sheet](cheatsheet.md)). This plugin ships the
> skill.

```markdown
---
name: build-test
description: Build the project, run go vet, check formatting and run the full test suite, then summarize results
allowed-tools: Bash(go:*), Bash(gofmt:*)
disable-model-invocation: true
---

# Build and test

Build the project and run the checks, in this order:

1. Build: `go build ./...`
2. Vet: `go vet ./...`
3. Format check: `gofmt -l .` (every file it prints is unformatted)
4. Test: `go test ./...`
...
```

- `name` — the skill's identifier; with the plugin prefix, `/2048-dev:build-test`.
- `description` — shown in the command autocomplete list.
- `allowed-tools` — pre-approves the tools the skill needs: `Bash(go:*)` means
  "any `go` command" may run without asking. Scope this narrowly — *which*
  tools, not "all tools".
- `disable-model-invocation: true` — **the one flag that makes a skill behave like
  the old command**: Claude won't auto-run it; only you can, via
  `/2048-dev:build-test`. Drop it and Claude may also invoke the skill on its own
  when your request matches the `description`.
- The body is the **prompt** Claude executes when you run it. Write it like a
  precise work order: numbered steps and what to report.

## Layer 2: the plugin manifest (`plugins/2048-dev/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)

```json
{
  "name": "2048-dev",
  "description": "Dev workflow skill (build-test) and the game-explorer agent for the 2048 workshop project",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "author": { "name": "Josef Klesa", "url": "https://github.com/klesajos" }
}
```

- `name` — the plugin's identifier; becomes the command prefix
  (`/2048-dev:...`). Only required field. Must not contain `:` — that
  character is reserved for the prefix.
- `version` — lets users see when the plugin changed and update.
- The manifest must sit in a `.claude-plugin/` folder **inside the plugin
  directory**. Content folders (`skills/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `workflows/`)
  sit **next to** `.claude-plugin/`, not inside it — that's the most common
  beginner mistake.

## Layer 3: the marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at repo root)

```json
{
  "name": "qti-ws",
  "owner": { "name": "Josef Klesa" },
  "description": "Plugins for the qti-ws Claude Code workshop (Quanti)",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "2048-dev",
      "source": "./plugins/2048-dev",
      "description": "Dev workflow skill (build-test) and the game-explorer agent for the 2048 workshop project"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `name` — the marketplace's identifier; appears after the `@` in
  `2048-dev@qti-ws`.
- `owner` — who maintains the catalog.
- `plugins` — the list of offered plugins. `source: "./plugins/2048-dev"`
  is a **relative path within this repo** — the plugin ships with the
  project. A source can also point elsewhere (another GitHub/GitLab repo, npm,
  a zip archive), which is how companies run one central marketplace for many
  plugins.

## Layer 4: auto-enable (`.claude/settings.json`)

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "qti-ws": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "klesajos/qti-ws" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "2048-dev@qti-ws": true
  }
}
```

- `extraKnownMarketplaces` — "this project uses the marketplace called
  `qti-ws`, fetch it from the GitHub repo `klesajos/qti-ws`". Anyone
  opening the project gets the marketplace registered automatically
  (after a trust prompt).
- `enabledPlugins` — "from that marketplace, turn on `2048-dev`". The key
  format is `<plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>`.

Together: clone the repo → open Claude Code → accept one prompt →
`/2048-dev:build-test` just works.

## Build your own plugin, step by step

1. **Create the plugin skeleton:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p plugins/my-plugin/.claude-plugin plugins/my-plugin/skills/hello
   ```
2. **Write the manifest** `plugins/my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` —
   copy the Layer 2 example, change `name` and `description`.
3. **Add a skill** `plugins/my-plugin/skills/hello/SKILL.md` — frontmatter with
   `name` + `description`, body with the instructions (see Layer 1). Add
   `disable-model-invocation: true` if you want it manual-only like build-test.
4. **List it in the marketplace** — add an entry to the `plugins` array in
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with `source: "./plugins/my-plugin"`.
5. **Validate** — Claude Code ships a checker:
   ```bash
   claude plugin validate .
   ```
   Fix anything it reports before continuing. (It also warns about names the
   Desktop app's managed sync would reject.)
6. **Test locally** inside Claude Code:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add ./
   /plugin install my-plugin@qti-ws
   ```
   Plugins installed this way activate immediately; type `/my-plugin:hello`
   to run your **skill**.
7. **Enable it for everyone** — add `"my-plugin@qti-ws": true` to
   `enabledPlugins` in `.claude/settings.json`.
8. **Commit everything and push.**

## Plugin vs. standalone skill/hook — which to choose?

- **Standalone** (`.claude/skills/`, hooks in settings): one project, zero
  ceremony. Start here — it's examples 1 and 2.
- **Plugin**: versioned, shareable across repos, bundles many pieces,
  installable with one command. Move to a plugin when a skill or hook
  proves useful beyond a single project.

## Optional parameters

**In `plugin.json`** (only `name` is required):

| Field | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `displayName` | Human-readable name shown in the plugin UI (may contain spaces) |
| `version` | Semantic version, e.g. `1.2.0`; without it the git commit is used |
| `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `keywords` | Metadata shown in marketplace listings |
| `defaultEnabled: false` | Ship the plugin opt-in: users see it but must enable it themselves |
| `skills`, `agents`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, `workflows`, `commands` | Override the default content paths — e.g. point `hooks` at a custom `hooks/hooks.json`. A plugin can bundle **all** of these, not just skills |
| `userConfig` | Declare settings the user fills in at install time (API endpoint, token…), available as `${user_config.KEY}` |

**In a `marketplace.json` plugin entry:**

| Field | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `description` | Shown in the marketplace listing (overridden by plugin.json if both set) |
| `version` | Catalog-level version (plugin.json wins if both present) |
| `category`, `tags` | Filtering and search in larger marketplaces |
| `source` as an object | Instead of a relative path: `{"source":"github","repo":"org/repo"}`, `{"source":"url","url":"https://gitlab.com/…"}`, `{"source":"npm","package":"@org/x"}`, `{"source":"archive","url":"https://…/plugin.zip"}` |

## Where it works: CLI, Desktop app, Cowork

| Platform | Works? | Setup |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Claude Code CLI** (terminal) | ✅ Yes | Nothing extra — `extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins` in the project settings register and enable the plugin after one trust prompt |
| **Claude Desktop app — Code tab** | ✅ Yes | Same as CLI: open the project, accept the trust dialog, `/2048-dev:build-test` appears. Desktop also has a plugin browser under the **+** button |
| **Cowork** (in the Desktop app) | ⚠️ Partially | Cowork does **not** read the in-repo marketplace or project settings. But Cowork has its own plugin system: install plugins through Cowork's plugin management (or upload a packaged `.plugin` file), and their skills then work in Cowork tasks. Plugin **hooks** depending on local tools may still behave differently in the sandbox |

So of the six mechanisms, plugins are the most portable to Cowork — the
*content* works there, only the in-repo *distribution channel*
(`extraKnownMarketplaces` in project settings) does not. For a team on
Cowork, publish the plugin to a shared marketplace and install it through
Cowork's plugin management instead.

## Try the demo

1. Open Claude Code in a fresh clone → accept the marketplace trust prompt.
2. Type `/2048-dev:` — `build-test` autocompletes.
3. Run it. Claude builds, vets, checks formatting, runs `go test ./...`, and
   reports a pass/fail summary without fixing anything — exactly what the
   **skill file** asked.

## Troubleshooting

- **Command doesn't autocomplete** → run `claude plugin validate .`;
  check the plugin is enabled in `/plugin` → "Manage plugins".
- **"Marketplace not trusted"** → you declined the prompt; re-add manually
  with `/plugin marketplace add ./`.
- **Changed the skill file but nothing happens** → run `/reload-plugins` or
  start a new session; plugin content is loaded at session start.
